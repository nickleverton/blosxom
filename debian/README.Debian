blosxom for Debian
-------------------

The setup of blosxom has been recently revised to support more flexible
setups. The plugins should now be stored below /etc/blosxom/plugins. If you
want to disable a plugin you don't have to remove it but can just rename it to
a filename that ends in "_" (e.g. "mv flavourdir flavourdir_").

The data files has to be placed in /var/lib/blosxom/data including the flavours
in subdirectories below the appropriate blog level.

This is blosxom 2.0, the plugin-enhanced version of blosxom for Debian.
Included are (for now) just two plugins in the package itself, but it
is easy to install more of the by now over 100 plugins: simply store them
in the (Debian) default location /etc/blosxom/plugins/ though plugin-specific
configuration variables may need to be set.

The plugins included are:

http://blosxom.cvs.sourceforge.net/blosxom/blosxom2-plugins/general/config
http://blosxom.cvs.sourceforge.net/blosxom/blosxom2-plugins/general/flavourdir
