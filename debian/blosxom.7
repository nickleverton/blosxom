.TH BLOSXOM 7 "February 5, 2003" Blosxom "7"
.SH NAME 
blosxom \- A lightweight yet feature-packed weblog
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blosxom 
is a simple web log (blog) CGI script written in perl. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBBlosxom\fP (pronounced "\fIblossom\fR") is a lightweight yet
feature-packed weblog application designed from the ground up with
simplicity, usability, and interoperability in mind.

Fundamental is its reliance upon the file system, folders and files as
its content database. Blosxom's weblog entries are plain text files
like any other. Write from the comfort of your favorite text editor
and hit the Save button. Create, edit, rename, and delete entries on
the command-line, via FTP, WebDAV, or anything else you might use to
manipulate your files. There's no import or export; entries are
nothing more complex than title on the first line, body being
everything thereafter.

Despite its tiny footprint, Blosxom doesn't skimp on features,
sporting the majority of features one would find in any other Weblog
application.

Blosxom is simple, straightforward, minimalist Perl affording even the
dabbler an opportunity for experimentation and customization. And
last, but not least, Blosxom is open source and free for the taking
and altering.

.SH USAGE
Write a weblog entry, and place it into the main data directory. Place the
the title is on the first line; the body is everything afterwards.  For
example, create a file named \fIfirst.txt\fR and put in it something like
this.
